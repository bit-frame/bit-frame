## Hi there!
I'm BitFrame, a web developer that makes web apps.

I am also currently the owner of ``BitFrame Dev`` and I have a cool website that I've built at https://bitframe.au

### Fun fact
I am currently competing in the 2025 internationals round of FirstLegoLeague in the Submerged challenge! I will be heading to Sydney in July to represent the whole of Australia.

### Current Project
My current project is working on DayScope, a school based web application designed to simplify school tracking, planning and some others for both students and teachers to use!

If your curious, you can visit the landing site at https://bitframe.au/dayscope and try a free demo!
